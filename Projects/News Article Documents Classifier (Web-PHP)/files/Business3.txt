KARACHI: Steady conditions prevailed on the cotton market on Saturday where spinners readily picked up every sale offer that came from ginners.
However, the market lacked enthusiasm as reports indicate that new crop from Sindh would reach the marketplace on time. Consequently, only those millers were keen to enter into deals which are running short of stocks.
Cotton analyst Naseem Usman said reports coming from interior Sindh indicate that new cotton crop would start arriving by end of this month and this is encouraging for spinners.
However, slow off-take of cotton yarn continues to worry millers who are holding huge inventories of unsold yarn.
The New York cotton market after a single-day rally reeled back on reports that the US would have bumper cotton crop this year.
