According to Annual Plan document, the electricity loadshedding caused substantial decline in economic growth.

The average supply remained at 14,400MW against the demand of 18400MW and the shortfall during April 2014 was due to fuel supply constraints and low hydroelectric generation.
It says that high fuel costs for thermal power generation, high losses in transmission and distribution inefficiencies of generation, below costs tariffs and non-payment of electricity dues by public and private consumers resulted in circular debt.
The document says that loadshedding will be eliminated by 2018 if new projects are completed on time.
According to reports, there are almost 30 percent line losses to total generation. State Minister for Water and Power recently announced that around 1200MW electricity is stolen on daily basis. An enquiry was called to investigate up to 1200MW electricity theft daily. State Minister alleged that National Transmission & Despatch Company, allied department of the ministry of water and power, was responsible for this theft. Results of that enquiry are still awaited.
