RAWALPINDI- The Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) on Tuesday welcomed the budget proposals for enhancing tax net with the hope that the finance ministry would continue its strives to improve the tax collection system by adopting simplified tax collection system.
RCCI Senior Vice President Shahid Salim, after the budget speech by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, said that the RCCI supported all the proposals to enhance the tax net with a commitment to further simplify the tax collection system.
He pointed out that the budget proposals did not give the time frame for the elimination or reduction of loadshedding which according to him was important factor to help alleviate the problems confronted the business and trade community.
He said that the finance minister while acting on the RCCI proposal had declared mandatory the production of National Tax Number (NTN) for seeking any utility service by an individual businessman.
Shahid indicated that the budget has proposed a number of incentives for the agriculture sector but there was no proposal to levy duty or tax on the income of the agriculture sector. He said that reduction in the import duty from 30 per cent to 25 per cent was welcomed but this reduction should have been to at- east 10 per cent to 15 per cent. Anjuman-e-Tajiran Rawalpindi president Sheikh Siddique, while commenting on the introduction of income tax through electricity bill, said this step would open up new ways for corruption. He asked, “A shopkeeper if in connivance with the WAPDA employee got more than one connection then what remedy would be to it?”
