Zaka Ashraf back as PCB chairman for third time ISLAMABAD, May 17 (Online): Former chairman Zaka Ashraf has been reinstated as chief of the Pakistan Cricket board for a third time after a ruling by the Islamabad High Court on Saturday.
The IHC decision came after a petition against Ashraf's sacking in February by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the patron of the PCB, who appointed an 11-strong interim committee led by Najam Sethi to run the board.
The IHC ruling on Saturday also declared invalid the notification issued on February 10 after the prime minister appointed the interim committee to run the affairs of the board.
The court ruling has also disqualified Najam Sethi as chief of the cricket board.
Ashraf was previously unseated as PCB chairman by a court order in May last year after doubts over his election kicked off a series of legal challenges that critics say has damaged the sport in Pakistan.
