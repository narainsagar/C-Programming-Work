upload assignment on slate and also make submission folders according to Section.
instead of demanding handwritten form on paper you just told the students to submit online on slate.
and provide the details of your machine in an .text file and make sure that name of your .txt file file should be 
your Roll No. i.e, (Kxx-xxxx) and only .txt will be accepted.

if you not follow these steps ur assignment will automatically be marked Zero.
