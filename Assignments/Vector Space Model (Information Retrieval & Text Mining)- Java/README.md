# Vector Space Model

Ref. folder name: `Vector Space Model (Information Retrieval & Text Mining)- Java`

### Introduction: 

It was my 2nd `Information Retrieval & Text Mining` course assignment.
First one is Boolean Retrieval Model which i coded in c++ you may find it (here)[https://github.com/narainsagar/free-my-university-programming-work-and-assignments/tree/master/Assignments/Boolean%20Retrieval%20Model/].

This assignment is implemented using Java - NetBeans IDE.

It uses 50 document collection dataset, their indexes, Stopword-List and lucene library in java.

##### Document Data Collection Dataset:

There is directory `IRTM-A2` which contains dataset, indexes, `StopWord-List.txt` and `QueryList.txt` in which we defines queries to run line by line..

##### Lucene Library:
Lucene Library Jar file is in the directory named `lucene-library-jar-file`.

##### Main Source Files:

Under the `src` directory contains package directory `vector space model` contains all java files which are:

-> `Indexer.java`
-> `LuceneConstants.java`
-> `Searcher.java`
-> `TextFileFilter.java`
-> `VectorSpaceModel.java`

For setting up this project, open/load this in NetBeans IDE or create new project named `Vector Space Model` and package name `vector space model` and add these files that are in the `src` folder.

That's it!

For understanding well this assignment, please read the .pdf file `Assignment2 - vector space model.pdf`.
